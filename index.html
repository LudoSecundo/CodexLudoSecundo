<h1>Warhammer 40,000: Codex Ludus Secundo</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <i>Codex Ludus Secundo</i>i>. This work hopes to sort and present the rules for Games Workshop’s classic game <i>Warhammer 40,000 (second edition)</i>i>.</p>

<h2>Where It All Began</h2>

<p><i>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</i>i> was a book of rules and worldbuilding lore for science fiction, table-top wargames. It was written by Rick Priestley et al with the brief of allowing players to make use of every wargaming model then produced by Games Workshop. Seeing as the company catalogue of the time included mythical monsters, licenced franchise characters, and models designed to look equally at home on a fantasy or historical battlefield, this led to the development of an eclectic yet suspiciously familiar setting.</p>

<p>First published in 1987, the rules for <i>Rogue Trader</i>i> were subsequently developed in supplemental books and articles in the magazine <i>White Dwarf</i>i>. With so many additional elements of the game spread across so many sources, it was eventually decided that everything needed tidying up into a single product.</p>

<h2>Now In A New Box!</h2>

<p>This resulted in the 1993 release of <i>Warhammer 40,000 (second edition)</i>i>, a boxed game containing rule books, models, and oh so many pieces of cardboard. The setting was refined into something more distinctive from the many franchises from which it had spawned. Rule revisions briefly published in fleetingly available magazines now had a permanent place on the shelf. Everything you needed to play was once again all there in a single, easy to find place.</p>

<p>Of course, over the following years, the rules for this new edition were subsequently developed in supplemental books and articles in the magazine <i>White Dwarf</i>i>. The rules once again became scattered over many sources, and it once again became hard to pin down what the rules actually were.</p>

<h2>Time’s Bullet Marches Forwards</h2>

<p>1998 saw the inevitable release of another new edition. However, where the second edition was a distillation of the sprawling first, the third was quite a different beast. The game was reimagined with a different flavour of both setting and gameplay. As a result, the second edition of the game never received the same streamlined re-release that it itself had provided for <i>Rogue Trader</i>i>. Fortunately, with the past now logged as complete and unchangeable, we the players can refine a re-release for ourselves.</p>

<h2>Oh, So It’s Like The Battle Bible?</h2>

<p>Anyone with a copy of the <i>Battle Bible</i>i> pinned among their favourite documents may find this project redundant. There is already a thriving community for this game that provides plenty of other resources. However, the <i>Codex Ludus Secundo</i> has a few differences that may still be of interest.</p>

<p>The <i>Battle Bible</i>i> was a highly compact distillation of the rules. It was a reference for players who already had some experience with the game, a document full of links and reference numbers tightly presented to ensure maximum information density.</p>

<p>This codex aims to present the same information at a slower pace. The web format allows for the inclusion of diagrams originally used alongside the rules. Where necessary, time will be taken to discuss some of the more confusing aspects of the game. Rules published in <i>White Dwarf</i>i> and the <i>Citadel Journal</i>i> will be included, clearly separated so readers know only to use them with the agreement of all players at the table.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important part of this project is that we intend to accompany the rules with citations. That way, the reader can check our workings!</p>

<h2>Thanks For Joining Us!</h2>

<p>If you have stuck with me this far, you have my eternal gratitude. I hope you stay and enjoy the wild world of the Second Edition.</p>

<p>The codex will be presented in three broad sections:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>General game rules.</li>
<li>Rules for specific armies.</li>
<li>Scenarios and other useful resources.</li>
</ul>  

<p>Of course, before we get to the meat of the game, we need to do some housekeeping. This will be conducted in Basic Principles. See you there!</p>
